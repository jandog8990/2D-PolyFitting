# 2D-PolyFitting for Computer Vision
2D Polynomial fitting using linear algebra for computer vision applications.

This project consists of two main classes Poly2D and a Test class for testing polys.

**Poly2D**
- Creates meshgrid from user input vectors
- Creates polynomials from user input matrices
- Creates matrices from user input polynomials
- Runs various algos such as SVD and QR decomposition
